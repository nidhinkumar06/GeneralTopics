## What is Cloud Native Apps

A. In the Digital transformation there is a new approach to develop and deploy applications known as cloud native 

B. It is a methodlogy of building and running applications which results in on-demand limitless computing on Public and Private cloud

C. Applications which are build and deployed using cloud-native has some characteristics namely
  * Microservice Architecture
  * Packaged in containers
  * Continuous Delivery
  * Dynamically managed in Cloud


### Microservice Architecture

* Cloud Native Apps are composed of microservice architecture where each application is a combination of mutliple services which can be operated independently
* Microservices are often owned by individual development teams which operates on their own schedules to Develop, Deploy, Scale

### Packaged as Containers

Containers provides isolation context for microservices.They are 

* Highly accesssible
* Scalable
* Easily portable
* Faster to create or teardown

Which makes them ideal for running microservices

### Continuous Delivery

* Cloud-Native apps runs on a continous delivery model that is Develop -> Build -> Test -> Deploy -> Release
* Software developer teams and IT operations teams collaborate to each other to build test, deploy and release it as soon as it is ready without affecting endusers or other development teams (Why other development teams? Because it is done in Microservice Architecture)
* This model encourage the DevOps principle which fasters the releationship between Software Development and IT operations


### Dynamically Managed

Cloud-Naive apps are dynamically mananged that is often build and run in modern cloud platform like Kubernetes (Which helps in Hardware decoupling helps in automatic scaling up and down, management)


### Advantages

* It greatly increases the developer productivity
* New application services and updates can be pushed to live applications without depending on other development teams
* Zero impact on enduser experience
