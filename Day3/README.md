</div>

## What is SSH?

In 1960 two communicate between computers they have used telnet which was unsecure. So in the mid 80's they have introduced Secure Shell Which sends message between Two computers Securely.

## How it is Secured.

* If there are 2 computers namely A and B. And if A wants to send Message to B it sends the message in a  Briefcase with a lock (Which means no one can see the message).

* Once the message is received on B. B will check for the key which it doesn't have so it puts it's own key to the briefcase and sends it to A to unlock A's key.

* Once A received the briefcase it unlocks it's key and sends it B

* Now B unlocks the briefcase and reads the message.
